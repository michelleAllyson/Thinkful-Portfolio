<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and a proud graduate of Pittsburgh Public Schools. I attended Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania (yes, it is a real place). My college highlights were joining a sorority (Tri Sigma) and studying abroad in Spain. I graduated with my degree in Special Education and Elementary Education</p>
    <p>My Top 3 Places to Visit in Pittsburgh</p>
    <ol> <li>Oakmont Bakery</li>
      <li>Kennywook Park(amusement park)</li>
      <li>Heinz Field to watch the Steelers Play</li>
      
    </ol>

    <p>With limited professional opportunities in Pittsburgh, my first professional teaching position was with Clark County School Distric in Las Vegas, NV (yes, people live there).Vegas quickly became and still is my home away from home. After teaching for 5.5 years in Vegas, it was time to return to Pittsburgh.</p>
    <p>My Top 3 Places to Visit in Vegas</p>
<ol> <li>Lucille's Barbeque</li>
      <li>Hoover Dam</li>
      <li>Ellis Island Casino</li>
      
    </ol>
<p>I am entering my 14th year of education during the 2023-2024 school year. Although its daunting to learn something new at 36, I am sincerely enjoying my experience with Thinkful. I look forward to implementing the skills I've learned and will learn in my future career endeavours. </p>
